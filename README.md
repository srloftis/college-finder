# college-finder

This visualization was designed and developed by Sarah Loftis for INFX 562 at the University of Washington. Inspiration for the design comes from [HomeFinder](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/trs/92-01/92-01.html). The code was created in part by following examples provided by the instructor, [Jessica Hullman](http://faculty.washington.edu/jhullman/), as well as [US State Map example code by Michelle Chandra](http://bl.ocks.org/michellechandra/0b2ce4923dc9b5809922) and [US State Map example code by Phil Pedruco](http://bl.ocks.org/phil-pedruco/7745589). The data used in this visualization comes from the [US Department of Education College Scorecard dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/).
